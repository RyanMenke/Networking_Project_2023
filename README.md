# Networking_Project_2023

How to run code:
1. Download project

2. Make sure there are proper "PeerInfor.cfg" and "Common.cfg" inside the working directory "src"

3. Cd into "src" and run "javac *.java" to compile all java files

4. After Compiling, still within the src directory, instantiate each PeerProcess with the command "java peerProcess 100*" where the "*" is replaced with the numbered peer process

5. ie: "java peerProcess 1001", "java peerProcess 1002", etc.

6. Instantiate them in order, and another terminal window will be required for each process.
